# Code3. 
Create a class TestMaths having the following:
        a. public void power(int base, int index)
If base = 2 and power = 3, the method should print 8.
        b. public void findFactorial(int number)
If number = 3, the method should print 6.
        c. public void findTable(int number)
If number = 2, the method should print 2’s table till 10th power.
        d. public void findPrime(int number)
Based upon the number, the method should print if it is prime or not.
